Our mind is a great sambhavam. It can just find reasons on it’s own to just make you feel like a piece of shit. You just have to trigger it with a minute inconvenience  and a trail of thoughts follow just to spice it up, to make us feel even more shittier. There’s no other worse enemy than our own mind when turned against us. Don’t ever risk your own existence asking this question whether you’re a failure to yourself, it just demonstrates you with a #examples why you’re a super duper failure. **Claps and claps, million reasons why..** 


There was a time when I believed being nice is the best thing one human can do. But there is no other tough time like that, you feel like your patience is getting tested. Do y’all feel blessed to have a person around you (who is nicer than you), so that you just don’t feel the pressure to be nice. Their nice aura makes others feel forgetful about my existence. It’s like the other person does the whole job for you. I miss my sister when my relatives are home. If you were there, I wouldn’t have to talk to them ***weees***


Nowadays it’s more amazing to hang out with people who are not nice. You’ve always wanted to say STFU, and you can actually say it. They all point out your deep insecurities. Yeah, on your face. You’re fat.Your face is big.  Hahahhh, jokes on you, Yo, whatever I got thicc skin (cries inside). What we all should do is probably keep quiet, which is more mature when getting roasted, like we don’t care. But who else does this, comeback with a worse burn which actually has something to do with their real character like “No wonder why you got dumped”. Gaah. Why did I just say that. I really wish if time travel was a real thing. 


You’ve received a message: “Your friend circle has shrunk by 1 in number because of your inappropriate burn”
